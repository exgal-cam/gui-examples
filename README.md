# gui-examples
A collection of GUI examples for programming-challenged astronomers like the author.

# 
# For the moment, the examples are thought to be run simply as
```python3 /path/to/example_file_name.py```

# Environment

As usual, it is strongly recommended to create an environment to run this code, least you break down your existing code.
```
conda create -n guitest python=3.10
conda activate guitest
```

At the moment, the necessary dependencies are installed with
```
conda install numpy matplotlib astropy scipy
```
